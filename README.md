# protector-estimand

Code to evaluate sample size requirements for estimands to evaluate clinical effectiveness of risk-reducing early salpingectomy (RRES) with delayed oophorectomy (DO).

## Overview 

The code is written in R in two files:

- **protector-risk_1.r**: summary statistics on expected risk, based on data in 250516-Penetrance_Assumptions.xlsx and 250617-protector-agesum.csv
- **protector-sampsi_2.r**: sample size and power estimation. Input files include those output by the first R script.
